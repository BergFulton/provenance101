######FAQs
1)_"I work with contemporary art. Does this apply to me?"_

Yes, yes it does. The provenance of a contemporary work may be very short, usually just the artist or gallery to a museum, but it is still important to capture and record it accurately. Remember that all old masters were once contemporary art! You're being kind to those who follow. 

Also, provenance is a way of proving authenticity, and thus very important for contemporary artwork. 

2)_"I can't read French/German/Italian/Dutch, will I get anything out of this?"_

Yes! Reading more than one language is certainly handy for doing provenance research, but translation services can help you push through, and Google Translate will give you a rough understanding of what you're reading. [DuoLingo](www.duolingo.com) is a great free resource for learning these languages as well. 

3)_"This is hard. Can't someone do it for me?"_

Yes, there are freelance provenance researchers who will complete your provenance research for you. Their services and expertise do not come cheap, however. You will likely need to pay for things like travel, duplication services, access fees, and translation services. While a professional researcher can help with a particularly difficult case, it is important for all professionals to have at least a passing understanding of how to read, write, and interpret provenance. It is a key element of collections stewardship and scholarship.

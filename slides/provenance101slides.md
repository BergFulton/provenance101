#_*Provenance Standards*_
####AAM suggested standard


...the provenanace is listed in chronological order, beginning with the earliest known owner.
Life dates of owners, if known, are enclosed in brackets.
Uncertain information is indicated by the terms "possibly" or "probably" and explained in footnotes.
Dealers, auction houses, or agents are enclosed in parentheses to distinguish them from private owners.
Relationships between owners and methods of transactions are indicated by punctuation:
a semicolon is used to indicate that the work passed directly between two owners
(including dealers, auction houses, or agents),
and a period is used to seperate two owners (including dealers, auction houses, or agents)
if a direct transfer did not occur or is not known to have occured.
Footnotes are used to document or clarify information. [^1]

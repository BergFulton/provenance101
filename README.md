##Hello! 
In this repo, you'll find some supplementary materials related to the panel interview and presentation for the position of Trainer on 18 March, 2016 at 5PM EST. 

##What is in this repo? 
In this repo, you'll find:  
1) `classoutline.md`  
	Contains the outline of the presentation, and what I hope to cover.  
2) `provenance_worksheet.md`/ `provenance_worksheet.pdf`  
A worksheet for investigating and writing provenance.  
3) `slides` folder  
Contains all slides & images for presentation. Contains `.md` file that generated the slides, and a PDF of the slides themselves.   
4) `resources.md`/`resources.pdf`  
A handy bibliography & quick reference for provenance sources.

##What should I do with it? 
These files are meant to provide you with some additional resources to take away from the session. If you'd like to look them over before we meet, I'd be happy to answer any questions and talk about them in more detail. 

##I have a suggestion!/You missed something.
Awesome! Please submit a pull request or an issues ticket and I'd be happy to take a look.
